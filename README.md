## PlayerbotsPanelEmulator
Client addon to simulate server side bot communication with PlayerbotsPanel https://github.com/azcguy/PlayerbotsPanel

This addon is for use with https://github.com/liyunfan1223/mod-playerbots 

## INSTRUCTIONS
Clone the repository into your AddOns folder

Create or use an account which will simulate a bot

Create a character that sims the bot

In the emu panel set master as the character with PlayerbotsPanel

Log into your main and register this new character as a bot

## Notes

Full functionality requires hacking the exe to allow protected functions to be run from lua.

Easiest, and safest way to do this is by using this python script https://gist.github.com/trevor403/90363a9edafd19094d844b1fbfdbb76e 

It requires pefile library which you can get through pip.

I am in no way endorsing hacking and i use this only for development of this emulator, on my own server.
